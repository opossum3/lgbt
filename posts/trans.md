They usually aren't aggressive and only attack if you bother them first, but when they do, they are willing to fight to their death to protect themelves and those like them from your slander.")

## Trans people are delusional.
Delusion refers to a belief in something that is verifiably not true and contrary to reality.

Tans people believe that
- they were _supposed to_ have a different body than they were born with (in terms of sex characteristics)
and/or
- live a different social role (in regards to gender) than they once lived as.

This internal idea/conviction of what sex you _ought_ to have or what gender you _ought_ to live as is what's called "gender identity".

Such a belief can't be verifiably untrue and contrary to reality, since it's explicitly a statement about something hypothetical (what was "supposed to" be). Hence it also can't be delusional.
