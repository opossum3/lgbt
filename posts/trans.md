A trans man is someone who at one point lived as a girl, but currently lives or wishes to live as a man. A trans woman is the reverse. You always refer to trans people with the gender they live as/would prefer to live as, not what they used to be - just like with someone changing their surname when marrying.

"Social transition" refers to coming out and usually working towards being perceived as the gender you want to be read as, changing pronouns, and the name you're referred by in day to day life.

"Medical transition" refers to medical procedures such as cross-sex hormone replacement therapy and various surgeries with the goal of changing your primary and/or secondary sex characteristics.

## Trans people are delusional.
Delusion refers to a belief in something that is verifiably not true and contrary to reality.

Trans people
- believe that they _should_ have had a different body (in terms of sex characteristics) than they were born with

and/or 
- want to live a different social role (in terms of gender) than they at some point lived.

**Beliefs about what was _supposed to_ have been, as well as wishes, can't be "contrary to reality", because they don't make statements about reality to begin with.**

Trans people do **not** think their bodies and social lives always match(ed) the gender and sex they want to embody, as some people claim. They are perfectly aware of the mismatch between their desires and their reality before transition, they wouldn't come out and typically undergo medical procedures if they weren't.

> This internal idea/conviction of what sex you _ought_ to be or what gender you _ought_ to live as - whether you do so already or not - is what's called "gender identity". Everyone has it, but trans people notice it the most, because their bodies and social life conflict(ed) with it.
